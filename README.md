# hello-world

Hey there,
I am new to the programming world, but I'm very excited to start learning, collaborating and growing as a web/software developer.  I'm in my third semester of the WebDev program, and have recently transferred to Scottsdale Community College.  I look forward to learning and growing within the community.
